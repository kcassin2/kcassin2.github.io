          I am getting ready for an event on Second Life. it is a celebration of the first opening of the Vordun museum and Gallery and second life. It is a German museum dedicated mostly to contemporary artist but also has some exhibits featuring real life classic ‘High’ art. My avatar is well underdressed as I enter the space filled with avatars fitted from head to toe in mimic designer gear. One-woman avatar in a short elegant red cocktail dress holding a virtual glass of champagne along side her ‘date’ dressed in a fitted suit holding a glass of virtual scotch on the rocks. I feel out of place as my avatar is noticeably wearing default clothing that comes on you as you start the game. It appears as the people behind their avatars notice this as no one is discussing with me the art. There comes an announcement that there will be a bidding on some of the artwork. Everyone then enters into ceasing to look at the artworks on the wall and in the display cases and situates themselves to watch the event that Is about to ensue. As it begins it is pretty much exactly how a normal bidding on artwork would work. Since there are microphones to communicate through it is easy to let the auctioneer know that you are willing to take the price. Bidding ends with the finally highest price for one of the ‘High’ artworks by Salvatore Rosa ‘Landscape with Mercury’ going for 20,000 lindens; a mere 62 US dollars. </p>
          <p>
We can understand ‘High art’ as ‘High Culture’. This encompasses cultural objects that have a certain aesthetic value in association with them. These are ‘High’ only because society collectively esteems them as ‘exemplary art’ (Gans, Herbert J, 2011). The culture created around this particular art is often associated with the upper class. A brief history tells us that this upper-class high art culture emerged in the 18th century (Gans, Herbert J, 2011). This is when we see the switch between works being commissioned directly from artist and instead traded. From then on, we can see a debate arise on what exactly makes art valuable (Gans, Herbert J, 2011).. Is it who is willing to pay for it? Or is it rather the non-financial value of art? When you stand in front of a long beloved artwork such as the Mona Lisa, is it the masterpiece that you are transfixed with, that you feel your consciousness being stretched by a tale that is timeless and ongoing? Perhaps these are the reasons why Second Life art can simply only be a mere imitation of this art and never reach it’s dream potential of ever becoming ‘High’ art. If we are to bring class back into a discussion of ‘High’ art and how it is both attained and maintained it’s status, those who are simply not in those circles cannot create ‘High’ art. Though the art spaces that you inhabit in second life are beautiful and vast, unworldly at times, they simply do not have the same monetary stature that something of its real-life counterpart would have. The patrons of second life can virtually preform as though what they are seeing, buying and creating is high art; but may not actually have any relation or relevance in such real-life participations.

	Perhaps the exploration of Second Life’s ‘High’ art or Upper-class culture Is more of an exploration of a long apparent class discrepancy. There can only be a high culture if there is a low culture. In the eyes of people in the true ‘High’ art culture who can afford to be in such positions; would the people of second life buying and trading these artworks and marketing them as high art be looked upon as being apart of a gross imitation by the lower class? For now, the answer would truly be unclear, however we do know that in all of these settings the beauty is in the eye of the beholder, or rather the seller in both cases.
