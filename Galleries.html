				Only after understanding fully Second Life and its users can you understand the art market that inhabits it’s space.
				Though Second Life’s art can exhibit itself anywhere on the virtual platform as people often purchase art for their 
				virtual homes and properties; we will be exploring the specific public spaces in which the art is ‘manufactured’, brought, and sold. The artist space in second life is
				an environment created where artist from all over the world can display their works to audiences far across the globe. Because of this
				it has created its own culture in a sense where many residents display their art in museums and galleries that are readily available
				to buy and build through Second Life’s tools. Gallery openings allow for art patrons to socialize and meet with the exhibiting artist
				leading to both real life and virtual sales of their works. The art galleries in Second Life are often referred to as ‘Sims’ or ‘gallery simulations (Virtually Real Museums).
				Some of the more notable and popular Sims on the platform are ‘Sisse Singhs’ art gallery, ‘Windlight’ gallery and ‘Horus’
				Gallery (Virtually Real Museums). These galleries are scattered across the map with each one of their virtual presence only 
				to be compared to in real life as the finest of galleries.

				<p>Except these it would take no money to travel and look at the landscape or art there. We also see a notable achievement of the first fully 
					stocked ‘art district’ come about. The space mocks an urban arts district such as Richmond Virginias or Vienna Austria’s art districts.
					Cetus, which is the name the district goes by, is filled with virtual galleries, offices, loft apartments and coffee houses. 
					Many of the buildings there are tenant-run businesses and feature weekly live music performances, gallery openings and literary 
					events such as virtual book launches and slam poetry (Virtually Real Museums). Its also important to note that the modeling tools 
					in Second Life allow the artist to create new forms of art that in many ways are not possible in real life due to numerous physical 
					constraints or high associated cost. Along with notable art spaces there are also notable artist who inhabit the platform as well. 
					In 2008 Haydn Shaughnessy who is a real-life gallerist hired a real-life architect Benn Dunkley to design a gallery in Second Life 
					(Virtually Real Museums). They set out to design the platforms first interactive gallery. ‘Ten Cubed’ was launched that year as a 
					‘radical departure’ in art exhibitions. It was said to have futuristically designed gallery showcasing art in a unique setting. The 
					owner and curator Shaughnessy selected five real life artists from around the globe to build the art (Virtually Real Museums). This 
					was not the first of its kind as many followed. However little to none of the exhibitions exist in what we know as the ‘High’ art 
					world. There are now over 2,050 art ‘museums’ in Second Life today (Virtually Real Museums).
