  <h1>The Versatility Of a Virtual Space</h1>
  
</div>
			
			<p> Second Life has created an environment where artists can 
				display their works to an audience across the world. This has created an 
				entire artistic culture where many residents display art in the museums, galleries
				and homes they can buy or build using Second Life's powerful tools. Gallery openings
				even allow art patrons to "meet" and socialize with exhibiting artists and has even led to many 
				real life sales.</p>
				<p>Numerous art gallery simulations (called "sims") abound in Second Life. Among the more popular galleries are the Sisse Singhs Art Gallery, 
				the Windlight art Gallery and the Horus Art Gallery. Among the most notable of these was the art gallery sim Cetus
				Gallery District, the world's first virtual online urban arts district. Cetus was modeled on real world analogs such as 
				New York's Chelsea gallery district as a mixed-use arts community of virtual galleries, offices, loft apartments, and 
				coffee houses. Its many tenant-run businesses featured weekly live music performances, gallery openings, and literary 
				events such as the virtual book launch for "Coming of Age in Second Life: An Anthropologist Explores the Virtually Human," by 
				Tom Boellstorf (Princeton University Press; 2008). Cetus was chosen Best Cultural Site in Second Life in 2007, and its creator 
				avatar Xander Ruttan (real world arts professional Aaron Collins of California), was among the most influential art world 
				avatars in SL. Cetus resulted in many ongoing collaborative efforts among the SL community of artists, designers, writers, and 
				virtual builders from across the real and virtual worlds. 
				(Cetus was later bought by virtual artist DB Bailey and converted into a personal art project).</p>
