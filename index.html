    <h2 class="center">Second Life</h2>
    <p>Second life is an online virtual world that was developed and currently owned 
	    by a San Francisco-based company by the name of Linden Labs. At its initial 
	    launch in 2003 it had over one million users.
	    Many view second life akin to a massive online role-playing game; however,
        its creator has said that it is not meant to be played as a game as there is no set objective. Instead it is important to 
        understand second life as a unique virtual environment that is designed to function as a realistic economic zone that enables it users to exchange
         services or virtual objects created and maintained in that environment. Players on the platform often support commercial activity that includes but is not limited to, the buying and 
         selling of ‘virtual property’.
	    They do this so through a virtual currency called Linden dollars (<em>Phillips, Louise Jane, 2010 </em>). </p>
